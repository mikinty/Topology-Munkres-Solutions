These solutions are for the \nth{2} edition Topology textbook by Munkres.

I am slowly going to evolve this guide as I work through the problems, but I'm
going to start summarizing each chapter before I do the problems, not only to
help me learn each chapter section, but also as a good study guide and reference
while doing the problems.
