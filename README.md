# Topology; A First Course Solutions (Munkres)

Once again, writing unofficial solutions for a math textbook. This time
Munkres's 2000 Topology, 2nd edition.

The PDF is located in the [`build/`](./build/main.pdf) folder of the repo.

If you want to contribute, feel free to fork and submit a PR!

## TODOs

I use `\TODO` to mark the problems that need work or don't have solutions.
There are also `TODO` comments if there are more minor parts that need work, e.g. spacing or prettier formatting.
