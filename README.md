Once again, writing unofficial solutions for a math textbook. This time

The PDF is located in the [`build/`](./build/main.pdf) folder of the repo.

## TODOs

I use `\TODO` to mark the problems that need work or don't have solutions.
There are also `TODO` comments if there are more minor parts that need work, e.g. spacing or prettier formatting.
